# RecoverDeletedJPGS
This is my program created for pset3(last), cs50x. It seeks to recover accidentally deleted jpgs files that are yet remained in the memory. 
User would be prompted to input a "filename" that contains bytes of jpgs, and then the program would iterate through the file, searching for existing jpgs, separating the jpgs by inputting them into newly created files until the end of the file.
